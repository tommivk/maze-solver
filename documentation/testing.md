# Methods of testing
## Unit tests
All of the algorithms are tested extensively with unit tests.

The total unit testing line coverage is 99% and branch coverage is 96%. MazeSolverUI and App classes are excluded from the test coverage. The integration and performance tests are also excluded.


### Kruskal

Depth first search is used in the tests to ensure that the maze generated by the Kruskal algorithm is connected. Also the tree structure used by Kruskal is tested to make sure that all of the trees are connected to each other after the maze has been generated.

### Growing Tree

The maze generated by the Growing tree algorithm is tested with a depth first search to ensure that the maze is connected. There is also unit tests in place to check that the algorithm removes walls of the maze correctly as it progresses.

### Tremaux's

A small test maze is created to check that the algorithm progresses correctly in it. Also small specific test mazes are made for each method that relates to movement in the maze or that are dependent of the state of the maze to ensure that the methods work correctly. 


### WallFollower
![wall_follower_coverage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52420413/174745715-ae7538c5-c8ea-499d-aee3-f3bcf0dc0796.png)

A small test maze is created to check that the algorithm progresses correctly in it. Also all of the  methods are tested individually with unit tests to ensure that they work correctly. 

---  

In some tests for methods that uses switch statements like Wall Followers `calculateNextMove` and Tremaux's `turnAround` methods the branch coverage is slighly lower because Jacoco is not able to evaluate them correctly.

## Integration tests

There are also integration tests in place where mazes of various sizes are created by using the Kruskal and Growing Tree algorithms and then solved with all of the maze solving algorithms. The tests include checks to make sure that the algorithms are always able to make it to the finish square. For tremaux it's also tested that all of the paths have been visited maximum of two times. For A*  there is a check to make sure that there is a valid shortest path from the end square to the beginning.  

## Performance tests

In performance tests it's possible to input the size of the maze(mazeSize) and the amount of mazes that will be generated(loops). Mazes will be generated both with Kruskal's and Growing tree algorithms and then solved with all of the maze solving algorithms. After the tests has run the average times of each algorithm will be outputted as milliseconds.
