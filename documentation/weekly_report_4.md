### What I did this week

- programmed a Tremaux's algorithm
- added control buttons to UI

### What difficulties I encountered

- Mazes generated by the Kruskal algorithm might not be the optimal for Tremaux's and in some edge cases the maze generated has a lot of junctions side by side and Tremaux's algorithm is not able to make the correct moves. 
Maybe this could be solved by recursively checking if the junction has a valid path connected to it before moving to it.
### What I will do next

- fix issues regarding the Tremaux's algorithm
- add more tests
- improve UI

Hours spent this week: 10
