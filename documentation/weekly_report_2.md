### What I did this week

- added JavaFx and jacoco to the project
- programmed an initial implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm for maze generation
- added animation/visualisation to maze generation using JavaFx timeline
- wrote unit tests for all of the classes
- added JavaDoc comments
- added checkstyle configuration

### What difficulties I encountered


- i had some difficulties with removing one side of the border from rectacle while keeping the other sides unchanged. I ended up creating a custom class for the rectangle and the state of the borders to make things easier 
- edge generating function  uses a nested loop for now
- not sure how the current data structures will work with the future algorithms yet and things may need to be changed

### What I will do next

- start working on implementing a Wall Follower algorithm

Hours spent this week: 12
